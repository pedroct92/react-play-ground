# General Considerations

- I have used create react app in order to simplify the process of the application.
- As I have litte expericen with the react ecosystem I did not use redux and related technologies due to time constrants.
- I am using rxjs as I use it on the daly basis (with angular) and even tough it is not quite popular on the react ecosystem I have tried to take leverage of the experience with this library!
- The application was not tested with unit tests. I did not have time to check the configuration of jest with typescript and react js. Event tough I am familiar with karma js and both api's are similar, it would require me some time to either use karma or take the time the check the configuration and intregration with typescript. 
- I have also deployed the application on heroku by using their react build pack [https://awesome-teams.herokuapp.com/](https://awesome-teams.herokuapp.com/) .
